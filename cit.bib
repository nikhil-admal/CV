                  loads exhibits an unusual hysteresis, characterized by a
                  sensitive dependence on the amplitude of the loads and a
                  dissipationless response at small amplitude. Observation of
                  the microscopic volume fraction at the level of a few bands
                  of martensite reveals that the main mechanism by which one
                  variant grows at the expense of another is a tip-splitting
                  event; the tips of martensite needles present in the specimen
                  suddenly split. This leads us to adopt a form of the energy

                  varying function that accounts for the loading device,

                  theory of crystal elasticity and dislocations in
                  crystals. The theory is founded upon suitable adaptations to
                  crystal lattices of elements of algebraic topology and
                  differential calculus such as chain complexes and homology
                  groups, differential forms and operators, and a theory of
                  integration of forms. In particular, we define the lattice
                  complex of a number of commonly encountered lattices,
                  including body-centered cubic and face-centered cubic
                  lattices. We show that material frame indifference naturally
                  leads to discrete notions of stress and strain in
                  lattices. Lattice defects such as dislocations are introduced
                  by means of locally lattice-invariant (but globally
                  incompatible) eigendeformations. The geometrical framework
                  affords discrete analogs of fundamental objects and relations
                  of the theory of linear elastic dislocations, such as the
                  dislocation density tensor, the equation of conservation of
                  Burgers vector, Kroner's relation and Mura's formula for the

                  small; we compute the L-limit of dilute dislocation

                  (EAM) description of alloy energetics with a
                  second-order-expansion (SOE) treatment of compositional and
                  displacive disorder. It is discussed in detail how the SOE
                  approach allows the EAM expression for the energy of a
                  substitutional alloy to be cast in the form of a generalized
                  lattice-gas Hamiltonian containing effective pair
                  interactions with arbitrary range. Furthermore, we show how
                  the SOE-EAM method can be combined with either mean-field or
                  Monte Carlo statistical mechanics techniques in order to
                  calculate short-range-order (SRO) parameters, average
                  nearest-neighbor bond lengths, and alloy thermodynamic
                  properties which include contributions from static displacive
                  relaxations and dynamic atomic vibrations. We demonstrate
                  that the contributions to alloy heats of mixing arising from
                  displacive relaxations can be sizeable, and that the neglect
                  of these terms can lead to large overestimations of
                  calculated phase-transition temperatures. The effects of
                  vibrational free-energy contributions on the results of
                  composition-temperature phase diagram calculations are
                  estimated to be relatively small for the phase-separating
                  alloy systems considered in this study. It is shown that
                  within the SOE approach displacive effects can act only to
                  displace the peak in the Fourier-transformed SRO parameter
                  away from Brillouin-zone-boundary special points and towards
                  the origin. Consistent with this result, we show that the
                  unusual SRO observed in diffuse scattering experiments for
                  Au-Ni solid solutions can be understood as arising from a
                  competition between chemical and displacive driving forces
                  which favor ordering and clustering, respectively.},

                  transitions often form complex twined microstructures with
                  multiple phase boundaries. They also exhibit hysteretic
                  mechanical behavior. We propose and analyze a one-dimensional
                  model for twinning. We consider two elastic bars coupled by a
                  system of continuously distributed linear springs. One of the
                  bars has a two-well nonconvex elastic energy density that
                  models a two-variant martensitic phase. The other bar is
                  linearly elastic and is meant to model the parent austenite
                  phase. Interfacial energy is modeled by a strain-gradient
                  term. Various types of boundary conditions model
                  parameter-dependent loading. A local bifurcation analysis
                  shows that local energy minima (metastable states) often
                  involve a large number of phase boundaries. This is confirmed
                  by the global-bifurcation diagrams obtained numerically. We
                  observe that this microstructure emerges via both sudden
                  (finite) and gradual (infinitesimal) phase nucleation. We
                  propose an energetic argument that predicts hysteresis in

                  multiple equilibria. A limiting case with zero interfacial

  abstract     = {Solids that exhibit localization of deformation (in the form
                  of shear bands) at sufficiently high levels of strain, are
                  frequently modeled by gradient type non-local constitutive
                  laws, i.e., continuum theories that include higher order
                  deformation gradients. These models incorporate a length
                  scale for the localized deformation zone and are either
                  postulated or justified from micromechanical
                  considerations. Of interest here is the consistent derivation
                  of such models from a given microstructure and the subsequent
                  investigation of their localization and stability behavior
                  under finite strains. In the interest of simplicity, the
                  microscopic model is a discrete, periodic, non-linear elastic
                  lattice structure in two or three dimensions. The
                  corresponding macroscopic model is a continuum constitutive
                  law involving displacement gradients of all orders. Attention
                  is focused on the simplest such model, namely the one whose
                  energy density includes gradients of the displacements only
                  up to the second order. The relation between the ellipticity
                  of the resulting first (local) and second (non-local) order
                  gradient models at finite strains, the stability of uniform
                  strain solutions and the possibility of localized deformation
                  zones is discussed. The investigations of the resulting
                  continuum are done for two different microstructures, the
                  second one of which approximates the behavior of perfect
                  monatomic crystals in plane strain. Localized strain
                  solutions based on the continuum approximation are possible
                  with the first microstructure but not with the
                  second. Implications for the stability of three-dimensional
                  crystals using realistic interaction potentials are also
                  discussed.},

                  interatomic interactions is indispensable to the fidelity of
                  atomistic simulations. In the development of popular
                  empirical potentials, it is assumed that atoms separated
                  beyond a certain cut-off distance have negligible interatomic
                  forces and hence may be safely ignored in the force
                  calculations. This arbitrary, and yet common, practice of
                  force truncation is undoubtedly ad hoc and is not grounded in
                  the physics of the interactions. With the advent of fast
                  computers and accurate first-principles calculations, it is
                  now feasible to determine what this cut-off distance should
                  be. In this work, employing a first-principles calculation
                  based on density functional theory and the local density
                  approximation (LDA) we probe the extent of interatomic forces
                  in aluminum caused by a variety of defect types. The forces
                  on neighbors to these defects, obtained from first-principles
                  calculations, were then compared with the corresponding
                  values from many short- and long-range semiempirical
                  literature potentials. It is clear that none of these
                  semiempirical potentials can reproduce the LDA results,
                  although the newest potentials that use LDA force data for
                  potential determination come close. The results also indicate
                  that nearest-neighbor forces are dominant for zero- and
                  one-dimensional defects. Only for a free surface did we find
                  forces at more distant neighbors to be comparable in
                  magnitude. Using the new LDA force data for the single
                  vacancy, we modify a literature potential to improve

  abstract     = {Martensitic transformations are diffusionless, solid-to-solid
                  phase transitions, and have been observed in metals, alloys,
                  ceramics and proteins. They are characterized by a rapid
                  change of crystal structure, accompanied by the development
                  of a rich microstructure. Martensitic transformations can be
                  irreversible, as seen in steels upon quenching, or they can
                  be reversible, such as those observed in shape-memory
                  alloys. In the latter case, the microstructures formed on
                  cooling are easily manipulated by loads and disappear upon
                  reheating. Here, using mathematical theory and numerical
                  simulation, we explain these sharp differences in behaviour
                  on the basis of the change in crystal symmetry during the
                  transition. We find that a necessary condition for
                  reversibility is that the symmetry groups of the parent and
                  product phases be included in a common finite symmetry
                  group. In these cases, the energy barrier to
                  lattice-invariant shear is generically higher than that
                  pertaining to the phase change and, consequently,
                  transformations of this type can occur with virtually no
                  plasticity. Irreversibility is inevitable in all other
                  martensitic transformations, where the energy barrier to
                  plastic deformation (via lattice-invariant shears, as in
                  twinning or slip) is no higher than the barrier to the phase
                  change itself. Various experimental observations confirm the
                  importance of the symmetry of the stable states in
                  determining the macroscopic reversibility of martensitic
                  transformations.},

                  derivation involves no a priori choice of asymptotic
                  expansion or ansatz. It yields a frame-indifferent Cosserat

                  applied to multi-well energy functions appropriate to
                  martensitic materials. It is found that, unlike in bulk
                  materials, which generally only support finely twinned
                  austenite/martensite interfaces as energy minimizing states,
                  the thin film theory predicts the existence of exact,
                  untwinned austenite/martensite interfaces. These are used to
                  construct some simple energy minimizing deformations - tents'

                  a model of rubberlike thermoelasticity proposed by Chadwick
                  (1974). Chadwick's model is generalized by allowing the

                  depending only on their product, as in the original

                  polymer networks, and with experimental findings, the

                  has proven to be a significant improvement in simplified
                  total-energy calculations for metallic systems. In the
                  current work, the ansatz used in the EAM is derived from the
                  local-density functional for the energy. The expression
                  demonstrated here is most appropriate for simple metals and
                  for transition metals with nearly empty or nearly full d
                  bands. An embedding energy is defined as a function of an
                  optimal constant background density, and an equation for that
                  optimal background density is obtained. The cohesive energy
                  is then related to the embedding energy and an electrostatic
                  two-body interaction. It is shown that lowest-order
                  electronic relaxations can be absorbed into the same
                  ansatz. Model calculations are presented for fcc nickel
                  within the Thomas-Fermi-Dirac-von Weizscker model for the
                  kinetic energy, with local exchange and correlation and
                  frozen-electron distributions. The model is shown to provide
                  a good description of the ground-state properties of nickel
                  (e.g., energetics and structure of vacancies and surfaces)
                  and also a good framework for evaluating the approximations
                  used in justifying the EAM form. In particular, the model
                  exhibits a simple relationship between the optimal constant
                  background density and the background density at the atomic
                  site. Corrections involving the gradient of the background
                  density are shown to be important in the calculation of the
                  surface energy. This work then provides a basis for the use
                  of the EAM in semiempirical applications. },

                  an fcc <110> nanowire. In MEAM simulations, the reorientation
                  consists of two successive processes. First, surface stress
                  and thermal vibrations cause the fcc <100> nanowire to
                  transform into a body centered tetragonal (bct)
                  nanowire. Second, the bct nanowire becomes unstable with
                  respect to shear and transforms into an fcc <110>
                  nanowire. In EAM and SEAM simulations a different
                  reorientation mechanism exists. The surface stress in the fcc
                  <100> nanowire induces slip on a {111}<112>
                  system. Progressive slip on adjacent {111} planes changes the

                  ACBACB, and the nanowire reorients into an fcc <110>
                  nanowire. The difference in reorientation mechanisms is
                  rooted in the differences in the unstable stacking fault

                  among these is that of a directional bond. Bond
                  directionality has been evoked as an explanation for the

                  the susceptibility to brittle failure, and preferred

                  is their thermally induced, stress-dependent shape memory
                  behavior. These alloys' remarkable properties are due to one
                  or more martensitic transformations near room temperature, in
                  which the crystalline configuration changes from a higher
                  symmetry austenite (cubic lattice), to a lower symmetry
                  martensite (rhombohedral, orthorhombic, tetragonal or
                  monoclinic lattice) with decreasing temperature. In contrast
                  to existing phenomenological approaches, the present work
                  constructs a continuum energy density function
                  $W(\mathbf{F};\theta)$ (as a function of a uniform
                  deformation gradient and temperature) of a perfect periodic
                  bi-atomic lattice from temperature dependent atomic
                  potentials. Of interest in this work are the equilibrium
                  solutions and their stability as functions of temperature for
                  crystals under no external stress. Although the full problem
                  is solved numerically, an asymptotic theory is necessary to
                  guide the numerical solution near multiple bifurcation
                  points. For a particular choice of the atomic potentials two
                  stable cubic phases are predicted, one that corresponds to
                  austenite (CsCl structure), which is stable at higher
                  temperatures, and one that has a denser packing (NaCl
                  structure), which is stable at lower temperatures. These
                  stable portions overlap at intermediate temperatures, which
                  is suggestive of a hysteretic temperature--induced
                  martensitic transformation. Lower symmetry crystals, such as
                  orthorhombic, monoclinic, and rhombohedral structures, are
                  also predicted. The first two of these are unstable within
                  the chosen temperature window for our particular case, while
                  the third is stable for higher temperatures. },

                  only high symmetry cubic configurations were found to be
                  stable (local energy minimizers). The present work derives an
                  energy density
                  $W(\textbf{F},\textbf{p}_1,\textbf{p}_2,\dots;\theta)$ that
                  explicitly accounts for a set of internal atomic degrees of
                  freedom $\textbf{p}_i$. In addition the model permits the
                  calculation of the crystal's dispersion relation which
                  determines the stability of the crystal against bounded
                  perturbations of all wavelengths. Using a specific model of a
                  bi-atomic crystal a stress-free bifurcation diagram is
                  generated (with the temperature serving as the loading
                  parameter). Equilibrium branches corresponding to the $B2$
                  (CsCl) and $B19$ (orthorhombic) crystal structures are found
                  to exist and satisfy the stability conditions in certain
                  temperature ranges. These results demonstrate the ability of
                  our model to provide valuable insight into the behavior of
                  shape memory alloys such as AuCd and NiTi.},

                  presented in the companion paper (Part I) to the study of
                  martensitic transformations found in shape memory alloys
                  (SMA's). The focus here is on temperature-induced martensitic
                  transformations of bi-atomic crystals under stress-free
                  loading conditions. A set of temperature-dependent atomic
                  potentials and a multilattice description are employed to
                  derive the energy density of a prototypical SMA ($B2$ cubic
                  austenite crystal). The bifurcation and stability behavior
                  are then investigated with respect to two stability criteria
                  (Cauchy-Born and Phonon). Using a $4$-lattice description
                  five different equilibrium crystal structures are predicted:
                  $B2$ cubic, $L1_0$ tetragonal, $B19$ orthorhombic, $Cmmm$
                  orthorhombic, and $B19'$ monoclinic. For our chosen model
                  only the $B2$ and $B19$ equilibrium paths have stable
                  segments which satisfy both the Cauchy-Born and
                  Phonon-stability criteria. These stable segments overlap in
                  temperature indicating the possibility of a hysteretic
                  temperature-induced proper martensitic transformation. The
                  $B2$ and $B19$ crystal structures are common in SMA's and
                  therefore the simulated jump in the deformation gradient at a
                  temperature for which both crystals are stable is compared to
                  experimental values for NiTi, AuCd, and CuAlNi. Good
                  agreement is found for the two SMA's which have cubic to
                  orthorhombic transformations (AuCd and CuAlNi).},

                  phase transformations in response to certain changes in
                  temperature or applied load. These martensitic
                  transformations result from a change in the \emph{stability}
                  of the material's crystal structure. It is therefore
                  desirable to have a detailed understanding of the possible
                  modes through which a crystal structure may become
                  unstable. The current work establishes the connections
                  between three crystalline stability criteria:
                  Phonon-stability, Homogenized-Continuum-stability, and the
                  presently introduced Cauchy-Born-stability

                  stability'' criterion, motivated by considering ``soft''
                  loading devices, is also introduced. This criterion
                  considers, in addition to all bounded perturbations, all

                  is subjected to a small linear displacement of its boundary,
                  then all atoms will follow this displacement. In the absence
                  of previous mathematical results, we study the validity of
                  this rule in the model case of a 2D cubic lattice interacting
                  via harmonic springs between nearest and diagonal
                  neighbours. Our main result is that for favourable values of
                  the spring constants and spring equilibrium lengths, the CB
                  rule is actually a theorem. Simple counterexamples show that

                  CB rule fails. Moreover the resulting overestimation of the

                  by convexification (let alone quasiconvexification) of the CB
                  energy. The main tool in our proof is a novel notion of
                  lattice polyconvexity which allows us to overcome the
                  difficulty that the elastic energy as a function of atomic
                  positions can never be convex, due to frame-indifference.},

                  tension-compression asymmetry in precipitated NiTi using
                  unique experimental results and micro-mechanical
                  modeling. For the first time, tensile and compressive
                  stress-strain behaviors were established on aged single
                  crystals ([100], [110], and [111] orientations) and
                  polycrystalline NiTi. The single crystal and polycrystalline
                  Ti-50.8 at.\% Ni materials were given both peak aged and over
                  aged heat treatments. The drawn polycrystalline NiTi has a
                  strong texture of the 111{110} type, thus it deformed in a
                  manner consistent with the [111] single crystals. In contrast
                  to the phenomenological theory of martensitic transformations
                  (analogous to Schmid's law), the critical resolved shear
                  stress required to trigger the transformation, Tau-crss, in the
                  peak-aged single crystals was dependent on both the stress
                  direction and crystallographic orientation. Using
                  micro-mechanical modeling, the deviation from Schmid's law
                  was attributed to the unique orientation relationship that
                  exists between the Ti3Ni4 precipitates (their coherent stress
                  fields) and the 24 martensite correspondence variant
                  pairs. The over-aged single crystals generally obeyed
                  Schmid's law within experimental error, consistent with the
                  proposed micro-mechanical model. Qualitatively, the
                  tension-compression asymmetry and orientation dependence of
                  the recoverable strain level, 0, was consistent with the
                  phenomenological theory for martensitic
                  transformations. However, the peak- and over-aged single
                  crystals generally both demonstrated smaller 0 magnitudes
                  than predicted. The differences for both crystals were
                  attributed to the inhibition of martensite detwinning coupled
                  with several unique microstructural effects. },

                  in the compressive response of open cell foams is governed by
                  cell ligament buckling. Significant insight into this
                  behavior can be gained by idealizing such foams as periodic,
                  space-filling Kelvin cells assigned several of the geometric
                  characteristics of actual foams. The cells are elongated in
                  the rise direction; the ligaments are assumed to be straight,
                  to have Plateau border cross sections, and nonuniform cross
                  sectional area distribution. The mechanical response of such
                  foams can be established using models of a characteristic
                  cell assigned appropriate periodicity conditions. The
                  ligaments are modeled as shear deformable beams. The
                  periodicity of this microstructure allows the use of Bloch
                  wave theory to conduct the search for the critical state
                  efficiently. The method tailored to the present
                  microstructure is outlined. It is subsequently used to
                  establish the critical states for uniaxial and a set of
                  triaxial loadings. A rich variety of buckling modes are
                  identified which are affected by the anisotropy and the
                  mutliaxiality of the applied loads. Under some loadings the
                  critical modes have long wavelengths which are shown to lead
                  to unstable postbuckling behavior involving
                  localization. Under other loading conditions the modes are
                  either local to the characteristic cell or involve an
                  assemblage of a few such cells. For the cases analyzed local
                  modes were found to have a stable postbuckling response.

                  alloys containing between 20 and 40 at.\% Ni was studied
                  using molecular dynamics simulations. The interatomic
                  interactions were represented using the embedded atom method
                  pseudo-monoatomic potentials, which were shown to represent
                  correctly the relative stability of the F.C.C. and

                  responsible for the remarkable behavior of shape memory
                  alloys. There is currently a need for shape memory alloys
                  with improved corrosion, fatigue, and other properties. The
                  development of new accurate models of martensitic phase
                  transformations based on the material's atomic composition
                  and crystal structure would lead to the ability to
                  computationally discover new improved shape memory
                  alloys. This paper explores the Effective Interaction
                  Potential method for modeling the material behavior of shape
                  memory alloys. In particular, an extensive parameter study of
                  the Morse pair potential model of the stress-free B2 cubic
                  crystal is performed. Results for the stability, potential
                  energy, current unit cell volume, instantaneous bulk modulus,
                  and the two instantaneous cubic shear moduli are presented
                  and discussed. It is found that an Effective Interaction
                  Potential model based on the Morse potential is appropriate
                  for modeling transformations between the B2 cubic structure
                  and the B19 orthorhombic structure, but is not likely to be
                  capable of simulating the B2 cubic to B19$'$ monoclinic
                  transformation found in the popular shape memory alloy
                  NiTi. In fact, this conclusion may be extended to all types

                  corresponding twinning elements and magnitude of the twin
                  shear. Further, two kinds of austenite-martensite
                  microstructures are studied: those with a single variant of

                  localized nucleation and propagation phenomena for a wider
                  range of loading rates and ambient thermal conditions. Local
                  self-heating (due to latent heat of transformation), the
                  inherent Clausius-Clapeyron relation (sensitivity of the

                  non-dimensional conductivity are identified to be the major
                  players in the range of responses observed. It is shown that

                  involve a sudden change of shape at a certain temperature. We
                  assume the existence of a free energy which depends on the
                  local change of shape and the temperature. Properties of this
                  function reflect the underlying symmetry of the parent and
                  product phases and an exchange of stability from parent to
                  product phase as the body is cooled through the
                  transformation temperature $\theta_0$. We concentrate on two
                  questions: (i) How can loads be applied to cause the body to
                  transform to a particular variant of the product phase at or
                  above $\theta_0$? (ii) Can the parent phase be recovered by
                  applying some system of loads at or below $\theta_0$? Theory
                  and experiment are compared for thermoelastic martensitic

                  old 680x0-based Apple Macintoshes. Owners of these machines
                  are mostly unaware that their floating-point arithmetic
                  hardware is capable of delivering routinely better results
                  than can be expected from the more prestigious and more
                  expensive workstations preferred by much of the academic
                  Computer Science community. This work attempts to awaken an
                  awareness of the difference in arithmetics by comparing
                  results for an idealized problem not entirely
                  unrepresentative of industrial strength computation. The
                  problem is to compute the deflection under load of a
                  discretized approximation to a horizontally cantilevered
                  steel spar. Discretization generates N simultaneous linear
                  equations that can be solved in time proportional to N as it
                  grows big, as it must to ensure physical verisimilitude of
                  the solution. There solution is programmed in MATLAB 4.2
                  which, like most computer languages nowadays, lacks any way
                  to mention those features that distinguish better arithmetics
                  from others. None the less this program yields results on PCs
                  and old Macs correct to at least 52 sig. bits for all values
                  N tried, up to N = 18827 on a Pentium. However the other
                  workstations yield roughly 52.3-4.67 log N correct sig. bits
                  from the same program despite that it tries two styles of
                  Iterative Refinement; at N=18827 only a half dozen bits are
                  left. This kind of experience raises troublesome questions
                  about the coverage of popular computer benchmarks, and about
                  the prospects for a would-be universal language like JAVA
                  that purports to deliver identical numerical results on all

                  since seen a great deal of development and application by a
                  number of researchers. The idea of the method is a relatively
                  simple one. With the goal of modeling an atomistic system
                  without explicitly treating every atom in the problem, the QC
                  provides a framework whereby degrees of freedom are
                  judiciously eliminated and force/ energy calculations are
                  expedited. This is combined with adaptive model refinement to
                  ensure that full atomistic detail is retained in regions of
                  the problem where it is required while continuum assumptions
                  reduce the computational demand elsewhere. This article
                  provides a review of the method, from its original
                  motivations and formulation to recent improvements and
                  developments. A summary of the important mechanics of
                  materials results that have been obtained using the QC
                  approach is presented. Finally, several related modeling

                  that set the upper limits of mechanical strength. Following
                  Gibbs, we determine the conditions that ensure stability
                  against reconfigurations that leave the boundary of the
                  system unchanged. The results hold independent of the nature
                  of properties of the loading mechanisms but are identical
                  with those derived previously for a solid in contact with a
                  reservoir that maintains the Cauchy stress. Mechanisms that
                  control the stress in some other way may add further
                  conditions of stability; nonetheless, the conditions of
                  internal stability must always be obeyed and can be
                  consistently used to define the ultimate strength. The
                  conditions of stability are contained in the requirement that
                  for all infinitesimal strains and B is the tensor that
                  governs the change in the Cauchy stress t during incremental
                  strain from a stressed state. Since has full Voigt symmetry,
                  it can be written as the 6x6 matrix with
                  eigenvalues. Stability is lost when the least of these
                  vanishes. The conditions of stability are exhibited for cubic
                  (hydrostatic), tetragonal (tensile) and monoclinic (shear)
                  distortions of a cubic crystal and some of their implications
                  are discussed. Elastic stability and the limits of strength
                  are now being explored through first-principles calculations
                  that increment uniaxial stretch or shear to find the maximum
                  stress. We discuss the nature of this limiting stress and the
                  steps that maybe taken to identify orthogonal instabilities
                  that might intrude before it is reached.},

                  significantly reduced in the presence of shear stresses. This
                  investigation is motivated by the desire to study the onset
                  of failure in fiber-reinforced composites under arbitrary
                  multi-axial loading and in the absence of the experimentally
                  inevitable imperfections and finite boundaries. By using a
                  finite strain continuum mechanics formulation for the
                  bifurcation (buckling) problem of a rate-independent,
                  perfectly periodic (layered) solid of infinite extent, we are
                  able to study the influence of load orientation, material
                  properties and fiber volume fraction on the onset of
                  instability in fiber-reinforced composites. Two applications

                  rubber-like behavior of martensite and the martensite
                  stabilization effect. Emphasis was laid on a recently
                  proposed general principle called symmetry-conforming
                  short-range order (SC-SRO), which states that there exists
                  interaction between crystal symmetry and distribution of
                  point defects such that the SRO tries to follow the crystal
                  symmetry, if in equilibrium. In fresh (unaged) martensite SRO
                  symmetry inherits the parent symmetry due to the
                  diffusionless nature of the martensitic transformation, thus
                  it does not match the crystal symmetry of martensite right
                  after the transformation. This is an unstable state; as a
                  result atomic diffusion occurs so as to correct the
                  'incorrect' SRO symmetry during the subsequent aging. This is
                  what occurs during martensite aging. This mechanism fully
                  explained all the known facts about martensite stabilization
                  and rubber-like behavior. We further provided TEM evidence
                  for the SC-SRO principle, and predicted two new effects,
                  which are expected from the SC-SRO principle: (i)
                  microstructure memory, and (ii) two-way shape memory (due to
                  aging). Both were verified experimentally. The
                  symmetry-conforming SRO property, which is a general property
                  of crystalline materials, may also be applied to a wide range
                  of phenomena concerning symmetry change.},

                  properties such as pre-transformation behaviors, which are
                  enriched by various martensitic transformations. The paper
                  starts from phase diagram, structures of martensites,
                  mechanisms of martensitic transformations, premartensitic
                  behavior, mechanism of shape memory and superelastic effects

                  transformations but also diffusional transformations, since
                  the latter greatly affect the former, and are useful to
                  improve shape memory characteristics. Thus the alloy system

  note	       = {Submitted to } # arch-r-mech,
  year	       = 1996,
  abstract     = {The investigation of microstructure is largely based on the
                  knowledge of the transformation twins the are possible for a
                  crystal undergoing a symmetry-breaking, diffusion-less phase
                  transition. In order to have a complete description of this
                  phenomenon, in this paper we review the subject of mechanical
                  twinning from the point of view of nonlinear elasticity, and
                  we examine the existence and genericity of all transformation
                  twins, that is, all the rank-1 connections between the
                  low-symmetry potential-wells occurring in a suitable
                  neighborhood of the high-symmetry well for all the
                  symmetry-breaking transitions that are possible in
                  three-dimensional simple lattices. The analysis also shows
                  that there are exceptions to the so-called ``Mallard law'',
                  according to which the twins arise generically from lost
                  symmetry planes and axes in the parent phase, and are
                  conjugate twins of Type 1 and 2, also called conventional
                  twins. In fact, we see that generic twins not of Type 1 or 2
                  do exist, and we describe all of them here, together with
                  various cases of non-conventional non-generic twins that can
                  exist in the transitions to monoclinic and triclinic
                  symmetries if the transition strains satisfy certain
                  relations that we give explicitly. It is remarkable that in
                  such non-generic transitions the greater number of twins
                  changes drastically the microstructures that the material can
                  form, and this may give away to control or enhance its
                  macroscopic properties. The analysis also shows that
                  Mallard's law holds if at least one of the twins in a
                  conjugate pair is required to have a material interface, or
                  if a restrictive notion of twin genericity is adopted.},

  abstract     = {Soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes, it was realized
                  that the theoretically predicted mechanical properties of
                  these interesting structures-including high strength, high
                  stiffness, low density and structural perfection-could make
                  them ideal for a wealth of technological applications. The
                  experimental verification, and in some cases refutation, of
                  these predictions, along with a number of computer simulation
                  methods applied to their modeling, has led over the past
                  decade to an improved but by no means complete understanding
                  of the mechanics of carbon nanotubes. We review the
                  theoretical predictions and discuss the experimental
                  techniques that are most often used for the challenging tasks
                  of visualizing and manipulating these tiny structures. We
                  also outline the computational approaches that have been
                  taken, including ab initio quantum mechanical simulations,
                  classical molecular dynamics, and continuum models. The
                  development of multiscale and multiphysics models and
                  simulation tools naturally arises as a result of the link
                  between basic scientific research and engineering
                  application; while this issue is still under intensive study,
                  we present here some of the approaches to this topic. Our
                  concentration throughout is on the exploration of mechanical
                  properties such as Young's modulus, bending stiffness,
                  buckling criteria, and tensile and compressive
                  strengths. Finally, we discuss several examples of exciting
                  applications that take advantage of these properties,
                  including nanoropes, filled nanotubes, nanoelectromechanical
                  systems, nanosensors, and nanotube-reinforced polymers. This

                  conducted in the temperature and deformation regime in which
                  it exhibits the \emph{shape memory effect} and
                  \emph{pseudoelasticity}. These remarkable characteristics
                  arise from the diffusionless transformation between two solid
                  state phases, \emph{austenite} and \emph{martensite}. Through
                  a systematic series of experiments, the loading rate and the
                  choice of ambient medium are found to have a significant
                  influence on the apparent mechanical response. Discrete local
                  measurements of strain and temperature show this to be caused
                  by a complex interaction between the temperature sensitivity
                  of the transformation stresses, self-heating or self-cooling
                  due to the latent heat of transformation, and the prevailing
                  heat transfer conditions of the experiment. A full field
                  monitoring scheme, using NiTi strip specimens, is developed
                  to track the nonuniform strain and temperature fields during
                  stress-induced phase transformations. Synchronized histories
                  of deformation, obtained by photographs of the disturbance of
                  a brittle coating on the surface, and temperature, obtained
                  by infrared thermal imaging, lead to a clear explanation of
                  the observed events. During loading (or unloading),
                  nucleation of the new phase is a distinct event requiring a
                  higher (lower) stress than that required to propagate the
                  transformation. This nucleation peak, coupled with the local
                  temperature changes, govern the number of nucleations. It is
                  also shown that under steady-state conditions coexisting
                  fronts all propagate at a speed that is inversely
                  proportional to the number of traveling fronts. Nucleation in
                  thin NiTi strips occurs in a sharp band, $55^o$ to the
                  loading axis. The transformation spreads by steady-state
                  propagation of inclined bands similar to those in the
                  literature of Luders bands in fine grained steel strips. In
                  NiTi the propagation also occasionally spreads by a
                  criss-cross pattern of finger-like features. These features
                  are captured in finite element simulations of thin strips by
                  treating the material as a finitely deforming elasto-plastic
                  solid having trilinear up-down-up nominal stress-strain
                  response. The success of this simple continuum model strongly
                  suggests that continuum level effects are the dominant
                  players in the unstable behavior of such fine grained
                  materials.},

                  exhibits the shape memory effect and pseudoelasticity. These
                  characteristics are due to the displacive nature of
                  transformation between the two major phases of the material,
                  austenite and martensite, and to the fact that in this alloy
                  martensite accommodates deformation by twinning. A series of
                  uniaxial experiments is conducted on NiTi wire at
                  temperatures in the range of approximately minus 20 to 100
                  degree C where the fundamental material response changes
                  drastically. In addition, the loading rate and the choice of

                  associated with the pseudoelastic material response. The
                  deformation history is established by photographically
                  recording surface changes of a brittle coating as
                  austenite-martensite phase transition fronts traverse the
                  specimen. Temperature changes are monitored by infrared
                  thermal imaging. Synchronized sets of optical and thermal
                  images and the corresponding stress histories are presented
                  for uniaxial experiments conducted at two relatively slow
                  end-displacement rates. The results help clarify the
                  interactions among the prevailing heat transfer conditions,
                  the loading rate and the fundamental sensitivity of
                  transformation stress to temperature. It is shown that,
                  during loading, nucleation of martensite in an austenitic

                  austenite in a martensitic region during unloading is lower
                  than the stress required to continue the transformation. This
                  distinction between the nucleation and propagation stresses,

                  latent heats of the two transformations, govern the number of
                  nucleations of a new phase. It is also shown that coexisting
                  transition fronts tend to propagate at the same speed which

                  strips under uniaxial tension. New experiments on NiTi
                  strips, which initially are in an austenitic phase, show that
                  at a critical stress level martensite nucleates in sharp
                  bands inclined at 55 degree to the axis of loading. Under
                  prescribed end displacement martensite subsequently spreads
                  either by steady-state propagation of inclined transition
                  fronts or via a criss-cross pattern of finger-like
                  features. Similar events have been reported in the literature
                  regarding the evolution of Luders bands in fine grained steel
                  strips and wires. The similarity of macroscopic events,
                  despite the different mechanisms of instability at the
                  micro-level, prompted us to approximate the material behavior
                  as a finitely deforming elasto-plastic solid with a trilinear
                  up-down-up nominal stress-strain response. Two such
                  stress-strain responses were used in finite element
                  simulations of strip tension tests. In the first the true
                  stress-strain response maintains its stability and in the

                  both material models produced inhomogeneous deformations with
                  features similar to those of the experiments, the larger
                  initiation peak associated with the second gave results which
                  closely resembled specific experiments. The numerical
                  simulations confirmed that the evolution of events seen in
                  experiments on SMAs and mild steels is strongly influenced by
                  overall geometric (structural) effects. Furthermore, the
                  success of this simple continuum constitutive model strongly
                  suggests that continuum level events remain dominant players
                  in such fine grained materials.},

                  oppositely charged polymethyl methacrylate spheres. Here we

                  structures, using combinations of semiconducting, metallic
                  and magnetic nanoparticle building blocks. At least ten of
                  these colloidal crystalline structures have not been reported
                  previously. We demonstrate that electrical charges on
                  sterically stabilized nanoparticles determine BNSL
                  stoichiometry; additional contributions from entropic, van

                  method for solving sparse systems of linear
                  equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the
                  topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition,
                  and their victims can be found to this day babbling
                  senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this
                  reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has
                  been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have
                  painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their
                  forebears. Nevertheless, the conjugate gradient method is a
                  composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can
                  understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself
                  will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic
                  forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of
                  steepest decent, conjugate directions, and conjugate
                  gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the
                  convergence of the jacobi method, steepest descent, and
                  conjugate gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and
                  the nonlinear conjugate gradient method. I have taken pains
                  to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations
                  are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained
                  in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an

                  consisting of point particles connected by bistable bonds are
                  considered. The bonds follow a trimeric piecewise linear
                  force-elongation diagram. Initially, Hooke's law is valid as
                  the first branch of the diagram; then, when the elongation
                  reaches the critical value, the tensile force drops to the
                  other. The latter branch can be parallel with the former
                  (mathematically this case is simpler) or have a different
                  inclination. For a prestressed lattice the dynamic transition
                  is found analytically as a wave localized between two
                  neighboring lines of the lattice particles. The transition
                  wave itself and dissipation waves carrying energy away from
                  the transition front are described. The conditions are
                  determined which allow the transition wave to exist. The
                  transition wave speed as a function of the prestress is
                  found. It is also found that, for the case of the transition
                  leading to an increased tangent modulus of the bond, there
                  exists nondivergent tail waves exponentially localized in a
                  vicinity of the transition line behind the transition
                  front. The previously obtained solutions for crack dynamics
                  in lattices appear now as a partial case corresponding to the
                  second branch having zero resistance. At the same time, the
                  lattice-with-a-moving-crack fundamental solutions are
                  essentially used here in obtaining those for the localized
                  transition waves in the bistable-bond lattices. Steady-state
                  dynamic regimes in infinite elastic and viscoelastic lattices
                  are studied analytically, while numerical simulations are
                  used for the related transient regimes in the square-cell
                  lattice. The numerical simulations confirm the existence of
                  the single-line transition waves and reveal multiple-line
                  waves. The analytical results are compared to the ones
                  obtained for a continuous elastic model and for a related
                  version of one-dimensional Frenkel-Kontorova model.},

                  first-principles energy calculations to obtain barrier
                  heights for these pathways in NaCl and in PbS. In both NaCl
                  and PbS, the barriers for the MB and T pathways are

                  the fact that a stable B33 intermediate structure is actually
                  observed in PbS does not favor the T pathway over the MB

                  potentials. Thereby, the kinematics are typically
                  characterized by the so-called Cauchy-Born rule representing
                  atomic distance vectors in the spatial configuration as an
                  affine mapping of the atomic distance vectors in the material
                  configuration in terms of the local deformation gradient. The
                  application of the Cauchy-Born rule requires sufficiently
                  homogeneous deformations of the underlying crystal. The model
                  is no more valid if the deformation becomes
                  inhomogeneous. Nevertheless the development of
                  microstructures with inhomogeneous deformation is
                  inevitable. In the present work, the Cauchy-Born rule is thus
                  extended to capture inhomogeneous deformations by the

                  0 K with temperature-dependent contributions that arise from
                  the minimization of the free energy at a finite
                  temperature. The structure and thermodynamic properties of
                  the defect can then be obtained with a molecular statics
                  program. The free energy is expressed within the harmonic
                  approximation, but since the interatomic potential at 0 K is
                  anharmonic, there is an additional temperature-dependent
                  force arising from the vibrational free energy. The same term
                  gives rise to the thermal expansion of the perfect crystal. A
                  second-moment approximation is applied to the phonon local

                  buckling-type instability encountered along proportional load
                  paths, where each load path is defined by a fixed macroscopic

                  microstructural imperfections on these failure surfaces, are
                  investigated through a combination of analytical (i.e., Bloch

  abstract     = {The electromagnetic forming (EMF) process is an attractive
                  manufacturing technique, which uses electromagnetic (Lorentz)
                  body forces to fabricate metallic parts. One of the many
                  advantages of EMF is the considerable ductility increase
                  observed in several metals, with aluminum featuring
                  prominently among them. The quantitative explanation of this
                  phenomenon is the primary motivation of this work. To study
                  the ductility increase due to EMF, an aluminum ring is placed
                  outside a fixed coil, which is connected to a capacitor. Upon
                  the capacitor's discharge, the time varying current in the
                  coil induces a larger current in the ring specimen and the
                  resulting Lorentz forces make it expand. The coupled
                  coil-ring electromagnetic and thermomechanical problem is
                  solved, using an experimentally obtained constitutive model
                  for a particular aluminum alloy. Our results show that for
                  realistic imperfections, the EMF ring starts necking at
                  strains about six times larger than its static counterpart,
                  as observed experimentally. This study establishes the
                  importance of solving the fully coupled electromagnetic and
                  thermomechanical problem and provides insight on how
                  different constitutive parameters influence ductility in an
                  EMF process.},

  abstract     = {The peculiar behavior of active crystals is due to the
                  presence of evolving phase mixtures the variety of which
                  depends on the number of coexisting phases and the
                  multiplicity of symmetry-related variants. According to
                  Gibbs' phase rule, the number of phases in a single-component
                  crystal is maximal at a triple point in the p-T phase
                  diagram. In the vicinity of this special point the number of
                  metastable twinned microstructures will also be the
                  highest--a desired effect for improving performance of smart
                  materials. To illustrate the complexity of the energy
                  landscape in the neighborhood of a triple point, and to
                  produce a workable example for numerical simulations, in this
                  paper we construct a generic Landau strain-energy function
                  for a crystal with the coexisting tetragonal (t),
                  orthorhombic (o), and monoclinic (m) phases. As a guideline,
                  we utilize the experimental observations and crystallographic
                  data on the t-o-m transformations of zirconia (ZrO2), a major
                  toughening agent for ceramics. After studying the kinematics
                  of the t-o-m phase transformations, we re-evaluate the
                  available experimental data on zirconia polymorphs, and
                  propose a new mechanism for the technologically important t-m
                  transition. In particular, our proposal entails the softening
                  of a different tetragonal modulus from the one previously
                  considered in the literature. We derive the simplest
                  expression for the energy function for a t-o-m crystal with a
                  triple point as the lowest-order polynomial in the relevant
                  strain components, exhibiting the complete set of wells
                  associated with the t-o-m phases and their symmetry-related
                  variants. By adding the potential of a hydrostatic loading,
                  we study the p-T phase diagram and the energy landscape of
                  our crystal in the vicinity of the t-o-m triple point. We
                  show that the simplest assumptions concerning the
                  order-parameter coupling and the temperature dependence of
                  the Landau coefficients produce a phase diagram that is in
                  good qualitative agreement with the experimental diagram of
                  ZrO2},

                  potential including the conduction electron volume-dependent
                  energy to fit the experimental data of both austenite and
                  martensite phases. A volume variation method is derived to
                  calculate the volume-dependent forces in cooperation with the
                  pairwise forces to govern the motions of atoms. The effect of
                  strain conditions on the growth rate of the martensitic
                  transformation has been investigated by varying the average
                  atomic density in the simulation box. The computer
                  simulations indicate that increasingly severe strain

                  configurations and the continuum theories of crystal
                  mechanics such as linear and nonlinear elasticity is given by
                  a natural hypothesis that goes back to Cauchy and Born,
                  referred to as the `Born rule'. This paper reports on an
                  extensive investigation on the validity of the Born rule and
                  the possibility of applying nonlinear elasticity to describe
                  the behavior of crystalline solids. This is done by studying
                  the phenomenon of mechanical twinning and its implications
                  for the invariance group of the energy density of the
                  crystal. The analysis leads to the conclusion that, in the
                  `generic' case, the Born rule does not hold and that
                  nonlinear elasticity theory cannot provide an adequate model
                  for crystal mechanics because an unphysical energy invariance
                  is derived. However, the Born rule works and elasticity
                  theory can be used for crystals whose twinning shears satisfy
                  certain quite restrictive `nongeneric' conditions. Relevant
                  experimental data confirm these theoretical negative
                  conclusions. It is remarkable that two very important classes
                  of `non-generic' materials to which an elastic model safely
                  applies do emerge experimentally: shape-memory alloys and
